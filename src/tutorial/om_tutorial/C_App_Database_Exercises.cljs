  # App Database Exercises

  Open the namespace `om-tutorial.app-database.exercises`. There are TODO
  placeholders for each exercise.

  When you have completed the task described by an exercise, the tests
  for those exercises will turn green.")

(dc/deftest exercise-1
  "In this exercise, you'll verify that you understand how to create a
  database table in the default Om database format.

  Create a table named `:cars/by-id` with the following items:

  ```
  { :id 1 :make \"Nissan\" :model \"Leaf\" }
  { :id 2 :make \"Dodge\" :model \"Dart\" }
  { :id 3 :make \"Ford\" :model \"Mustang\" }
  ```

  These tests shown below will pass when the table is
  correctly formatted.
  "
  (is (= "Nissan" (-> cars-table (get-in [:cars/by-id 1]) :make)))
  (is (= "Dodge" (-> cars-table (get-in [:cars/by-id 2]) :make)))
  (is (= "Ford" (-> cars-table (get-in [:cars/by-id 3]) :make))))

(dc/deftest exercise-2
  "In this exercise, you'll use Idents to link together data
  in an app database.

  Merge the cars table into provided favorites database, then
  add a `:favorite-car` key that uses an ident to reference
  the Nissan Leaf.

  "
  (is (= "Nissan" (->> (get favorites :favorite-car) (get-in favorites) (:make)))))

(dc/deftest exercise-3
  "This exercise has you build up more of a UI, but all as normalized
  components.

  Say you want to have the following UI data:

  ```
  { :main-panel { :toolbar { :tools [ {:id 1 :label \"Cut\"} {:id 2 :label \"Copy\"} ]}
                  :canvas  { :data [ {:id 5 :x 1 :y 3} ]}}}
  ```

  but you want to normalize tool instances using `:tools/by-id`, data via `:data/by-id`.
  Use the invented idents `[:toolbar :main]` and `[:canvas :main]` to move the toolbar and canvas to
  tables of their own.

  Build the normalized database in `ex3-uidb`.

  The following tests will pass when you get the format correct.
  "
  (is (= {:main-panel
          {:toolbar {:tools [{:label "Cut"} {:label "Copy"}]},
           :canvas  {:data [{:x 1, :y 3}]}}}
        (om/db->tree '[{:main-panel [{:toolbar [{:tools [:label]}]}
                                     {:canvas [{:data [:x :y]}]}]}] ex3-uidb ex3-uidb))))
